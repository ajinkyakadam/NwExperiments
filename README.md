This repository represents a collection of all the networking experiments that I have worked on so far and the ones that I am currently working on. The experiments involve usage of tools like Quagga, Mininet, POX Controller which helps me better understand the working of different routing protocols like OSPF, BGP, ISIS, RIPng, RIP and also build software defined networks. 

Each sub-directory represents a single experiment. All the configuration files related to that experiment are provided in that directory. Also the file `Readme.md` in each sub-directory explains what the experiment goal is and how I ran those experiments.
